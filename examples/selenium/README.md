# Performance testing with Selenium
In this repo we have some examples on how to gather performance metrics continuously using selenium.

The selenium script is written in JavaScript to stay consistent with other scripts but it can easily be done with other languages like python or .net.

To run the script continuously type in the terminal:

'''
while true; do node script.js; sleep 30; done
'''
