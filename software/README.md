# Workshop Software requirements
In this workshop we will be using some software apps.

Below you will find a list of the needed software.
The folder sections contain some instructions that will guide you getting the software and having it ready to arrive at the Workshop.

- NodeJs
- JMeter
- k6
- InfluxDB
- Grafana
- Prometheus
- Jenkins

These are standalone installs.
We are working on a docker compose that may make things easier for the most and get everything with just a few simple commands. It is a WIP, but if you would like to help it is very welcome, fork this repo and do a PR. :smiley:
